The apps available to you as well as your own downloaded apps. I was surprised it came with 3d. I ordered some 3d movies and have watched a few and the picture is clear. The only thing is that there was no instructions for the 3d glasses."

Love the point/laser style remote control. Works faster than scrolling up/down/sideways. If you want a top of the line TV, this one is awesome!"
